| - attic: contains previous runs of "consent", "demog" and "rating" files that are obtained when   
|         runnig the sort_results.sh script to split the results file downloaded from PCIbex into  
|         these 3 files
|
| - sort_results.sh: shell script which sorts results recorded by Ibex into plausibility ratings, 
|                    demographics, consent. Removes practice items, as well as commented lines
|
| - GP6 FollowUp_PlausibilityRatingStudy: full experiment downloaded from PCIbex
|
| - consent.txt: contains consent of participants
|
| - demog.txt: contains demographic data of participants
|
| - rating.txt: contains plausibility ratings of participants
|
| - plaus_original.r: R script received from Christoph
|
| - plaus_changed.r: R script with applied changes, i.e. adapted to my plausibility rating study
|
| - plausresults.csv: file created by running the R script in order to create the plots
|
| - DensityPlot_Plausibility_Target.pdf: density plots displaying average plausibility ratings for 
|                                        each item for the target variant for conditions A, B, C (bar |                                        plots only in R script)
|
| - Density_plot_Plausibility_Distractor.pdf: density plots displaying average plausibility ratings |                                             for each item for the distractors for conditions A, B, |                                             C (bar plots only in R script)
|
| - results_original.csv: results file containing the test results when I did the experiment
|
| - results_changed.csv: contains the test results file but with a manipulated column B (changed |                        ID) in order to simulate having several participants and not just my ID
|
| - results_all.csv: final csv file containing the results of all participants
|
| - results_wc: used when splitting the results file into the 3 txt files but not sure what exacly  
|               its function is
