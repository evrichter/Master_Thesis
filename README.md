# Master’s Thesis

This repository contains the code, data, and analyses for my master’s thesis in the field of psycholinguistics, completed as part of the Language Science and Technology program at Saarland University.  
The thesis investigates how plausibility and expectancy (operationalized as surprisal) influence sentence comprehension, with a focus on comparing offline and online plausibility ratings as predictors of processing effort.

## Structure
- **0_Stimuli/** — sentence materials used across experiments.  
- **1_Plausibility_Rating_Study/** — offline plausibility pre-test to assess perceived plausibility.  
- **2_Surprisal_Values/** — surprisal values from GPT-2/LeoLM as a measure of expectancy.  
- **3a_SPR_Study/** — first self-paced reading experiment with online plausibility ratings.  
- **3b_SPR_Study_2/** — second self-paced reading experiment without ratings.  
- **Combined_Plots/** — scripts for generating cross-experiment figures.  
- **Master_Thesis.pdf** — full thesis document.

## Summary
Plausibility ratings and surprisal values were used as pre-tests to assess sentence plausibility and expectancy.  
Two self-paced reading studies served as the main experiments, comparing offline vs. online plausibility ratings as predictors of reading times.  
The work contributes to understanding how different levels of plausibility and varying degrees of granularity can account for variability in human sentence processing.
